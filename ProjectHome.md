The development of the original ELA stopped in June 22nd, 2006, the final version is 0.10 beta `R18`, which is for WordPress older than version 2.3. Because of the changes of WP database structure, the original ELA did not work in WordPress 2.3 or later. Nevertheless, bloggers can not stop loving it. Many worm hearted programmers fixed this plugin again and again. Till now, you can still find a few working versions of ELA for even WordPress 2.7 or later(This project is also one of them). Of course, this kind of searching work is not that easy.

Although there are many patches of ELA, none of them make it better. All the patches you can find are to fix ELA under a certain WordPress version. The aim of this project is to make ELA stronger, faster and easier to use. And this page will exist untill Google company is closed down.
